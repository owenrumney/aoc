# Advent of Code

This repository contains the code for each day of the [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com).

My intention is to complete each day using Go as a vehicle to improve my proficiency with the language. If it gets too difficult for any given day I may use Python or Scala to get it done.

## Premise

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
